# Dragon-Ball-Z---Leggendary-Super-Warriors---Remake

remake of original gbc game in Java.

Personal project (therefore not forked) in the development of a game menu in Java with Swing. The basic idea was to learn Java during the university period with the development of a game. References to the original video game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_Legendary_Super_Warriors
Still it has been interrupted because of the vastness of its development and the lack of time between study and work. However, you are free to create another branch and to continue development and contact me
